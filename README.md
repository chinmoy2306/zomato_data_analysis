# Project : Zomato Dataset Analysis
## Overview
-	This repository showcases my data analysis project performed using MySQL on the dummy zomato dataset. 
-	The dataset was obtained from Kaggle and consists of several files such as: `products.csv`, `sales.csv` etc, which were used to gain insights and perform various analysis on the Zomato dataset. 
## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis consists of the following files:
-	`products.csv`: This file contains information about the different food items available on Zomato, including their names, prices etc.
-	`sales.csv`: This file provides data on the sales made on Zomato, including the user who made the purchase, the product purchased, the quantity, and the order date.
-	`users.csv`: This file contains details about the users of Zomato, including their names, contact information, etc.
-	`gold_users.csv`: This file contains information about users who have subscribed to Zomato's premium gold membership.
## Project Structure
This repository is structured as follows:
-	`README.md`
-	`products.csv`
-	`sales.csv`
-	`users.csv`
-	`gold_users.csv`
-	`zomato_analysis.sql`

 	- Raw dataset files:
		- `products.csv`
		- `sales.csv`
		- `users.csv` 
		- `gold_users.csv`
	- `zomato_analysis.sql`: 
		- This SQL script contains the queries used for data analysis on the Zomato dataset.
		- The queries cover various aspects, such as sales analysis, user segmentation, product categorization, etc.
	Feel free to explore the `zomato_analysis.sql` file to view the specific queries used in this analysis.
